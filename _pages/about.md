# How it works

## Host Onboarding with Stripe

### Why Stripe Integration is Required
All hosts must complete onboarding with Stripe to ensure:
- **Safer transactions** for both tenants and hosts
- **Payment protection** through secure, regulated financial infrastructure
- **Fraud prevention** with advanced security measures
- **Compliance** with financial regulations and anti-money laundering laws
- **Dispute resolution** support for transaction issues

### Know Your Customer (KYC) Requirements
Stripe requires the following information during host onboarding to comply with federal regulations:
- **Date of Birth (DOB)** - For identity verification and age confirmation
- **Social Security Number (SSN)** - Required by law for tax reporting and identity verification
- **Physical Address** - To verify your location and comply with regional regulations
- **Government-issued ID** - Additional identity verification
- **Bank account information** - For secure payment processing and payouts

These requirements are mandated by federal law and financial regulations, not by Apateu. Stripe is a regulated financial services provider that must verify the identity of all users processing payments.

## Payment Processing Timeline

### ACH Transaction Processing
- **Standard ACH transfers**: 3-5 business days
- **First payout**: May take up to 7 business days for new accounts
- **Subsequent payouts**: 3-5 business days after tenant payment

### Security Deposit Handling
Hosts have the right to request and hold security deposits until the end of the lease term. At lease completion:
- **Host decision**: The host must decide how much of the deposit to return and provide reasoning for any deductions
- **Deposit release**: Any approved deposit amount is released to the tenant with the host's explanation
- **Dispute resolution**: If the tenant disputes the host's decision, Apateu reserves the right to make the final determination on the deposit return amount
