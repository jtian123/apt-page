## 13. Information Security Policy

We maintain a comprehensive Information Security Policy to protect your data and financial information:

- **Infrastructure & Hosting:** Our backend services are hosted on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** in secure Virtual Private Clouds (VPC). Access to AWS management console is restricted with **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** and role-based permissions. Firewalls and security groups limit inbound and outbound traffic.
  
- **Database Security:** We use **MongoDB Atlas** as our managed database service. MongoDB Atlas enforces **encryption at rest (AES-256)**, **TLS 1.2+ encryption in transit**, **IP whitelisting**, and **role-based database access controls**. No direct client access to the database is permitted.

- **API Key Security:** All API keys and credentials (Plaid, Stripe, AWS) are stored securely using environment variables and never exposed in client-side code or version control systems.

- **Token Security:** Plaid access tokens and Stripe credentials are never exposed to clients and are securely stored on backend servers only.

- **Data Encryption:** All sensitive data is encrypted using TLS 1.2+ during transmission and AES-256 when stored.

- **Access Control:** Role-based permissions enforced across all systems. MFA required for administrative access to AWS, database, and deployment environments.

- **Employee Security Training:** All employees undergo annual security and compliance training and sign confidentiality agreements.

- **Third-Party Vendor Management:** We only integrate with trusted vendors (Plaid, Stripe, AWS, MongoDB) and regularly review their compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001).

- **Logging:** Application logs do not contain sensitive user data such as bank account numbers, Plaid tokens, or PII. Sensitive actions are masked or anonymized.

- **Incident Response:** In case of a security incident:
  - Contain and isolate the system.
  - Rotate API keys and revoke compromised credentials immediately.
  - Notify affected users and comply with legal reporting obligations.

- **Risk Management:** We perform quarterly vulnerability scans, monitor AWS GuardDuty alerts, and schedule annual penetration testing.

- **Monitoring:** All system access is monitored for anomalies using AWS CloudWatch and alerting mechanisms.

- **Policy Review:** Reviewed annually and after major changes to maintain compliance with SOC 2, GDPR, and CCPA.

By using our Platform, you agree to these security practices.
